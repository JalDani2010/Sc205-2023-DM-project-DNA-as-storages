                    1. High storage density: DNA has an incredibly high storage density, with the potential to store
                    vast amounts of data in a very small space. It is estimated that a single gram of DNA can store up
                    to one exabyte (1 billion gigabytes) of data.<br><br>

                    2. Longevity: DNA has the potential for long-term data storage. Under optimal conditions, DNA can
                    remain stable for thousands of years, making it a potential solution for archival storage. <br><br>
                    3. Data stability: DNA is a stable molecule that can withstand extreme conditions such as
                    temperature, humidity, and radiation. This makes it suitable for storing data in harsh environments.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Information security: DNA storage offers the potential for enhanced data security. Encoding data
                    in DNA can provide an additional layer of protection against hacking and cyber threats, as DNA-based
                    storage systems can be designed to be highly secure and resistant to unauthorized access. <br><br>

                <h2>
                    &#9830; Cons of DNA storage:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1. Cost: Currently, DNA storage is an expensive technology. The process of synthesizing, sequencing,
                    and reading DNA is costly and time-consuming, making it less economically viable for large-scale
                    data storage compared to traditional storage methods. <br><br>
                    2. Access time: Retrieving data from DNA storage is a relatively slow process compared to electronic
                    storage devices. The time required for synthesizing and sequencing DNA, as well as extracting the
                    desired data, can be a significant drawback for applications that require rapid access to data.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Technical complexity: DNA storage involves complex processes such as DNA synthesis, encoding,
                    sequencing, and decoding. These processes require specialized equipment, expertise, and
                    infrastructure, which can limit its widespread adoption. <br><br>
                    4. Limited technology maturity: DNA storage is still an emerging technology and is not yet
                    commercially available or widely adopted. Further research and development are needed to optimize
                    the storage and retrieval processes, improve scalability, and reduce costs before it can become a
                    practical and mainstream storage solution. <br><br>
                    5. It's important to note that while DNA storage shows promise for certain applications, it is not
                    intended to replace conventional storage methods entirely. It is more likely to be used for specific
                    use cases where the advantages of high-density and long-term storage outweigh the associated costs
                    and technical complexities. <br><br>
