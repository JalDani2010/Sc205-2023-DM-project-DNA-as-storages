            There are plenty of other emerging storages like DNA. E.g., Mainly Quantum Computing, Optical Storage are emerging storages like DNA. They have their advantages and their disadvantages also.

        <p>
            Quantum computing is an emerging technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations faster than traditional computers. <br>

It has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and process data, allowing for faster and more efficient computations. <br>

However, quantum computing is still in its initial stages, and current quantum computers are relatively small and expensive. They also require specialized equipment and expertise to operate and have limitations in terms of scalability and reliability.<br>

        </h2>
        <p>
            Optical storage is a type of storage technology that uses lasers to read and write data to a disc or other medium. <br>

It has been around for several decades and is widely used for storing and distributing media such as CDs and DVDs.<br> 

Optical storage has the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to use, with high read and write speeds. However, it has limited capacity compared to other storage technologies, and is not as durable or stable as DNA storage.<br>
