            <p>
                DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in
                DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases:
                adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly
                accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.

            <p>
                DNA sequencing may be used to determine the sequence of individual genes, larger genetic regions (i.e.
                clusters of genes or operons), full chromosomes, or entire genomes of any organism. DNA sequencing is
                also the most efficient way to indirectly sequence RNA or proteins (via their open reading frames). In
                fact, DNA sequencing has become a key technology in many areas of biology and other sciences such as
                medicine, forensics, and anthropology.

            <p>
                DNA synthesis is the process whereby deoxynucleic acids (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) are
                linked together to form DNA. It occurs in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes, as well as some viruses. The
                accurate synthesis of DNA is important in order to avoid mutations to DNA. In humans, mutations could
                lead to diseases such as cancer so DNA synthesis, and the machinery involved in vivo, has been studied
                extensively throughout the decades. In the future these studies may be used to develop technologies
                involving DNA synthesis, to be used in data storage.

                There are several different definitions for DNA synthesis: it can refer to DNA replication - DNA
                biosynthesis (in vivo DNA amplification), polymerase chain reaction - enzymatic DNA synthesis (in vitro
                DNA amplification) or gene synthesis - physically creating artificial gene sequences.
