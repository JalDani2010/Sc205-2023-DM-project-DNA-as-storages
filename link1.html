                <p>● Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a material that stores information in life.<br>
                    ● DNA molecules have genetic blueprints for living cells and organisms.<br>
                    ● DNA is a complex molecular structure that is found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and in
                    many viruses.<br>
                    ● DNA codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits.<br></p>

                <h2>&#9830; Structure of DNA</h2>
                <p>
                    ● Structure of DNA is a double-helix polymer, a spiral consisting of two DNA strands wound around
                    each other.<br>
                    ● Each strand of a DNA molecule is composed of a long chain of monomer nucleotides. The nucleotides
                    of DNA consist of a deoxyribose sugar molecule to which is attached a phosphate group and one of
                    four nitrogenous bases.<br>
                    ● A DNA spiral has multiple and alternating pairs of four unique bases.<br>
                    ● They are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).<br>
                    ● These bases are attached to the DNA spiral in pairs, called base pairs. The two base pairs are
                    adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine.<br>
                    ● One strand is held to another by hydrogen bonds between the bases; the sequencing of this bonding
                    is specific.<br>
