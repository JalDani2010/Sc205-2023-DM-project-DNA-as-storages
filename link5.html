                &#8226; DNA computing is an emerging branch of unconventional computing, which uses DNA, biochemistry and
                molecular biology hardware instead of traditional electronic computing.<br><br> &#8226; Research and development in this
                area, concerns theory, experiments and application of DNA computing.<br><br> &#8226; Although the field originally
                started with a demonstration of computing applications, it has now been expanded to several other
                avenues such as development of storage technologies, nanoscale, imaging modalities, synthetic
                controllers and reaction, network etc.<br><br> &#8226; DNA computing is performing the competitions using biological
                molecules rather than traditional silicon chips.<br><br> &#8226; A computation maybe that is the execution of an
                algorithm which itself may be defined as an step-by-step list of well-defined instructions, that takes
                some input, process it and produces a result.<br><br> &#8226; In DNA computing, information is represented using the
                four-character genetic alphabet (A [adenine], G [guanine], C [cytosine], and T [thymine]), rather than
                the binary alphabet (1 and 0) used by traditional computers.<br><br> &#8226; This is achievable because short DNA
                molecules of any arbitrary sequence may be synthesized to order.<br><br> &#8226; An algorithm's input is therefore
                represented (in the simplest case) by DNA molecules with specific sequences, the instructions are
                carried out by laboratory operations on the molecules (such as sorting them according to length or
                chopping strands containing a certain subsequence), and the result is defined as some property of the
                final set of molecules.<br><br>
